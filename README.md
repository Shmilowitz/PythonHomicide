Solutions

## 1.Which ethnicity is it most common for the victims and perpetrators to be?  
There is a lot of "unknowns" in both graphs, which makes it harder to make it harder to analyze.  
Hispanic are more involved in crimes than non-hispanic(Both victims and perpetrators).  
Less unknown ethnicity in victim's graph. Probably easier to document the ethnicity of victims than perpetrators for unsolved cases.
